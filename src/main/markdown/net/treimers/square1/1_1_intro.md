# Introduction

You can use this application to model your scrambled Square-1. There is a awesome puzzle page from Jaap Scherphuis available [at his home page](https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/index.htm "Jaap's Puzzle Page") with different puzzles like Rubik's cube and many others.

Jaap created an own sub page for the Square-1 puzzle with detailed description, theory of solving algorithms or solver programs. He also introduced a notation used to specify a Square-1 position as well as a second one to define the moves used to scramble or solve this puzzle. All of this can be found on this [Square-1 page](https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/square1.htm) at Jaap's puzzle collection.

This application supports you to convert the position of your twisted Square-1 to Jaap's notation. This might be helpful when using his solver programs to get help when restoring a scrambled Square-1 to its original state.

I am planning to add a solving algorithm to this application next allowing you to do all the steps with the help of this program.
