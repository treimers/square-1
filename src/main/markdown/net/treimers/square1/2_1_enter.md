You can consecutively add all pieces using drag and drop until the scrambled Square-1 is completed. Filling will take place according to the notation beginning with position one in the top layer.

Note that there are text fields available in the bottom left of this dialog for the position. You can also enter pieces using their name by hitting the corresponding character on your keyboard. Also you can remove pieces via these fields with the delete key.

Helper buttons to rotate the Square-1 and all pieces or to return to the solved position, the empty position or the last position are available as well.
